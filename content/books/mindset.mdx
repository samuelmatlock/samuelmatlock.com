People with fixed mindsets believe the qualities that determine their success are predetermined. People with growth mindsets believe these qualities can be developed through their own intentional direction and effort. Carol Dweck explores the outcomes of people with each mindset in-terms of personal success, sports, business, and relationships and shows the importance of adopting a growth mindset.

This book was far better than I expected, in part because I underestimated how critical the growth mindset is. After reading, I'm reminded that this mindset is not just a useful, but a necessary ingredient for all sustainable forms of success. Its also the root of the most antifragile approach to personal growth in anything, which involves constant action, observation, and iteration.
